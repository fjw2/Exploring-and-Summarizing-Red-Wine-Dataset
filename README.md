# Exploring-and-Summarizing-Red-Wine-Dataset

This project explores a red wine dataset containing 13 different 
variables that influence its overall rating.  This project was a part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree program.

## Key points achieved throughout this project:

-Understanding the distribution of a variable and to check for anomalies and outliers

-Learning how to quantify and visualize individual variables within a data set by using appropriate plots such as scatter plots, histograms, bar charts, and box plots

-Exploring variables to identify the most important variables and relationships within a data set before building predictive models; calculate correlations, and investigate conditional means

-Learning powerful methods and visualizations for examining relationships among multiple variables, such as reshaping data frames and using aesthetics like color and shape to uncover more information
